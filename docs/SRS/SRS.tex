\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
Sustaining a healthy lifestyle requires people to keep track of their eating, exercising, and sleeping habits. This can prove to be a daunting and time consuming thing to do especially when most people are very busy with their lives. The purpose of this project to create an all in one health and wellness mobile application that allows users to manage their diet, exercise, and sleep. REVITALIZE is designed to supply users with the means to improve their health by providing them with meal recipe's based on their nutritional preferences, a personalized workouts planner and a sleep tracker. 

\subsection{Scope}
REVITALIZE will allow users to find recipes for meals based on nutritional preferences such as calories per meal, diet selections, allergies to avoid and ingredients included. The user will be able to count their calorie and nutrient intake through the nutrition logger. The workout planner will allow users to choose from an already existing list of workouts or construct their own workout schedule along with weights, sets, and repetitions. The sleep tracker will provide users with information regarding their sleep. There will be a focus on improving user experience throughout the application along with supplying users with accurate data regarding their health.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
The goal of this project is to make REVITALIZE, for it's stakeholders, the go to, easy to use, quick, and accessible all in one mobile application for effectively and efficiently managing a person's diet, exercise, and sleep to improve their overall health and well being. The goal of making REVITALIZE a mobile application is for it to be easily accessible to users from their phone at any time and place. Users do not have to memorize their health goals or write them down on a piece of paper that they carry with them all the time. The goal of documenting this project is for stakeholders to have a physical system documentation of a functional product that they can refer to when needed. Stakeholders will be able to match the application to the documentation.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{Primary Stakeholders}
Adults and teenagers who want to improve and keep track of their overall health and wellness via an easy to use, all in one application.

\subsubsection{Secondary Stakeholders}
Individuals who may not use the application directly for themselves or are not directly involved with the use of the application but have an indirect benefit. For instance, personal trainers can use REVITALIZE to keep track of workouts, sleep, and the overall health of their clients.

\subsubsection{Facilitating Stakeholders}
Team 13 members building the REVITALIZE application along with Dr.Spencer Smith and the 4G06 TAs.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
The REVITALIZE team members have not completed their investigation of how to make mobile applications compatible with screen reader tools to make REVITALIZE accessible to users with impaired vision.\\

Moreover, the level of difficulty of maintaining and scaling this project is an open issue as it is highly dependent on the implementation. The team has not yet completed it's assessment of the projection of users, costs, and allocated budget to make a current decision on the maintainability and scalability of the project.\\

Another open issue is regarding the way capacity testing will be conducted:
\begin{itemize}
\item The team has yet to determine how it will find and group a large pool of people simultaneously, ideally 50 or more, to test the application's performance before launch.
\item Determining how to gather large masses user data points, ideally 1 million+, to test the application's storage capacity and performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}


\subsection{New Problems}
Potential new problems that the REVITALIZE team can encounter include:
\begin{itemize}
\item API failures
\item Server connection errors
\item Copy right issues
\end{itemize}
API failures can occur as a result of connectivity issues, a connection breakdown to the URL, or if it's overloaded with requests from the REVITALIZE application. It is possible to encounter copyright issues when using images from the internet to add visuals to the application. This may or may not complicate the graphical user interface design process. A server connection error is less common but may occur due to a network connection error or if the server is offline.

\subsection{Tasks}
Tasks are scheduled and delegated as per the project \href{https://github.com/BillNguyen1999/REVITALIZE/blob/main/projectschedule/REVITALIZE.pdf}{\color{blue}Gantt Chart}. It will be updated throughout the project to include required tasks and their completion status.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
NA

\subsection{Risks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Risk 1: Project may be too complex to complete in eight months because it makes use of multiple built-in and external libraries, other frameworks and application programming interfaces
\begin{itemize}
\item Probability of risk becoming a problem: Medium
\item Contingency plan: Change project scope to meet the minimum number of goals and requirements set by the team to deliver the project
\end{itemize}
\item Risk 2: What if primary stakeholders are not too excited about using the REVITALIZE application after it's launched?
\begin{itemize}
\item Probability of risk becoming a problem: Medium
\item Contingency plan: REVITALIZE team members shall speak to primary stakeholders and listen to their feedback to improve the application.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}
The estimated time cost to deliver this project is eight months. This includes gathering requirements, designing, documenting, implementing, and testing. The cost of launching REVITALIZE to the Google Play Store and App Store are 25\$ and 99\$ respectively.[1]

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
No user documentation is required to use REVITALIZE. Users will be able to download REVITALIZE as a mobile application from either the Google Play Store or App Store. No training is necessary as using REVITALIZE will be intuitive.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
Ideas that are currently in the waiting room that shall be developed, given enough time, include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Personal Trainer Integration
\begin{itemize}
\item A user's personal trainer can set their diet, workout, and sleep schedules. The trainer can also view user's progress and adjust their schedules.
\end{itemize}
\item Sleep Data Predictor
\begin{itemize}
\item A sleep data predictor that takes users sleep data to extrapolate their health conditions and give tips on optimizing their sleep.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
Possible ideas to make REVITALIZE accessible to all people include designing clear layouts, increasing font sizes, increasing text visibility, using large buttons and controls, and describing user interface elements. Another idea to prevent API failures is to run tests to monitor and track API performance from early development through production.

\section{Reflection Appendix}

\subsection{Knowledge and Skills Needed}

\noindent Bill Nguyen: Skills that need to acquire are end to end development, CI/CD, multiple ways of testing (integration, unit, acceptance tests etc...). Will be needed since project is end to end (front-end, back-end, database etc.), will be using CI/CD to deploy code changes, and will be testing project in multiple ways.

\subsection{How Knowledge and Skills Will Be Acquired}
\noindent Bill Nguyen: Project will be end to end so will implement code in front-end, back-end etc. and will be integrating all components to make it an end to end project. Will use CI/CD in project to integrate and deploy code, so will add necessary steps in yaml file to make and update CI/CD process. Will research and implement unit, integration, acceptance tests etc. to learn more about multiple types of tests.
